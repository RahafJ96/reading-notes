# Functions in JavaScript

## Defining functions:
JavaScript functions are defined with the function keyword. It can be used as a function declaration or a function expression. 
The construction of the function:
- The name of the function.
- A list of commands to the function, surrounded in parentheses and separated by commas.
- The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

_function nameOfTheFuntion(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
}_

Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and it will used when they are recall later in the code.

## Function Expressions
A JavaScript function can also be defined using an expression. A function expression can be stored in a variable, _as shown in the example: var x = function (a, b) {return a * b};_
