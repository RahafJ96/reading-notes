#  What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team?

## Why do some groups thrive and others falter?

Traditionally, employee workplace performance has been studied at the individual level; figuring out how to make employees more productive versions of themselves. However, it has become imperative to consider team performance optimization as the majority of modern work has become more and more team based.  In fact, within most modern organizations, teams have become the basic unit in which an organization operates.  

In order for communities to stay competitive, management should not only focus on how their employees are working individually, but also how they work together.Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, sociologists and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better and more productive versions of themselves.

Since every team is made up of individuals, when every member learns to utilize more of her/his potential with personal development, the team can be more effective. In addition when they work on themselves, they will learn and/or improve their communication skills which will eliminate communication breakdowns and result in empathy as well as sensitivity toward team members.
