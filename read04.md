# Programming with JavaScript
#### **JavaScript** is the world's most popular programming language. It is the programming language of the Web. JavaScript is easy to learn. 


## Javascript Operators
JavaScript includes operators as in other languages. An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result. For example 1 + 2, where + sign is an operator and 1 is left operand and 2 is right operand. + operator adds two numeric values and produces a result which is 3 in this case.

## JavaScript includes following categories of operators:

**1. Arithmetic Operators:** are used to perform mathematical operations between numeric operands.

**2. Comparison Operators:**:that compare two operands and return Boolean value true or false.

**3. Logical Operators:** are used to combine two or more conditions. JavaScript includes following logical operators.

**4. Assignment Operators:** In JavaScript assignment operators is included to assign values to variables with less key strokes.

**5 Conditional Operators:**starts with conditional expression followed by ? operator. Second part ( after ? and before : operator) will be executed if condition turns out to be true. If condition becomes false then third part (after :) will be executed.


## Control Flow in Javascript
Control flow is in computer science the order that the instructions or statements or functions are executed. In javascript, we read the code starting from the first line till the last line unless of course in the code there is some instructions or statements that changes that control flow. 
**_The most known control flow used I would think is the "if statement"_**

 >_**For example**, you want a website to show some page if you are sign in, if not, the website would render a different page is a traditional example of a control flow/ conditional example_
