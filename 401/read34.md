# [Monetization](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/earn/monetization-options)

* To maximize your revenue, consider a flexible monetization strategy that adapts to your audiences and markets.
* Different audiences can have different preferences for paid apps, in-app purchases, subscriptions, ads, and other ecommerce.
* When you're developing a mobile application for Android and distributing it on Google Play, there are two primary ways you can accept payments:
    1. Google Play's billing system
    2. Google Pay.

### Sell physical goods or services with Google Pay
Products where we recommend developers use Google Pay include the following:

1. **Retail merchandise**, such as groceries, clothing, housewares, and electronics.
2. **Physical services**, including taxi and transportation services, cleaning services, food delivery, airfare, and event tickets.
3. **One-time membership fees or recurring dues**, including gym memberships, loyalty programs, or clubs offering accessories, clothing, or other physical products.
4. **Electronic bill payment**, including credit card bills, utilities, and cable or telecommunications services.

### Other app monetization options
Get paid for showing Google AdMob ads, including native ads that allow you to match ads to your app's look and feel.

- **Paid apps**
Set a price for your app that the user must pay before they can download and install it.
