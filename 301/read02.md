# Git Introduction

## Version Control System (VCS):
Version Control is a system that allows to revisit several versions of a file or set of files by documenting changes.In version control, you can return a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and compare them. By using a Version Control System (VCS), that can make mistakes in the files easily be detecte.

## What is Git?
Git  is a a mature, actively maintained open source project that stores data in a file system as a snapshots and rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like VCS *as explained above*, in Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.

## Graphical Clients
### Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons.

### Git Repository
These are some of Terminal Commands that we learned, we use them in the terminal (GUI or Git Bash)
- **pwd:** to see where I am now
- **ls:** to see the list for my (folders) and files (without the hidden files)
- **ls -la:** to list all files (with the hidden files).
- **mkdir:** to create a directory.
- **cd:** to open a specific directory.
- **cd ..:** to go back from my current directory.


### After working on the Git in your local machine **_in our case we used replit_** You can upload it and save the changes by adding some commands which are:

- git add .

- git commit â€“m " **WHY** we do the changes"

- git push origin main
