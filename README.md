# Reading Notes
## Introduction:
Hello, my name is Rahaf Al-Jazzazi. I'm 24 years old. I graduated with a bachelor degree in Electrical and Communication engineering from German Jordanian University. I got deeper to programming in my internship and I'm here hoping that I can gain more knowledge and be a good developer.
